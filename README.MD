## Installation

It is highly recommended that you start this project from scratch, following along with the [Calyptus Solana Track](calyptus.co). However, if you want to use this project as a starting point, you can fork and clone this repo, then run `yarn install` to install all the dependencies.

**NOTE:** You must use yarn to install the dependencies. If you use a different package manager, you will run into issues minting the NFT.

## Common Issues

### Program Id

If you use this project as a starting point, you will need to change the program id in the `anchor.toml` file and inside the `declare_id!` macro in the `lib.rs` file. To obtain the program id for your project, run `anchor keys list` in the terminal. You will see a list of all the keys associated with your project. The program id should look like this: `solana_nft_anchor: PROGRAM ID`.
